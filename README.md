## Exercizes of "Programmieren-1"

This repository contains exercizes of lectures during the module "Programmieren 1" of my computer science study.
First we learned programming in C, which is used most of the time. Starting at "Uebung-10" I used C++.
The actual exercizes-papers are not uploaded, because they belong to my programming-lecturer.
